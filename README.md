Decision tree classification is a machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions or predictions. It recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant features, creating a hierarchical tree where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the final class or outcome. Decision trees are interpretable, versatile, and widely used for tasks such as classification, regression, and feature selection in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and natural language processing.
